                    “In an agricultural society, or during a time of exploration
                    and settlement, or hunting and fathering–which is to say,
                    most of mankind’s history–energetic boys were particularly
                    prized for their strength, speed, and agility. […] As
                    recently as the 1950s, most families still had some kind of
                    agricultural connection. Many of these children, girls as
                    well as boys, would have been directing their energy and
                    physicality in constructive ways: doing farm chores, baling
                    hay, splashing in the swimming hole, climbing trees, racing
                    to the sandlot for a game of baseball. Their unregimented
                    play would have been steeped in nature.”

                video games.Even though gaming has been around for almost 50
                years, studies about its harms are still in the early stages.
                Different groups have come to different conclusions about
                whether problem playing should be called an addiction. There we

                Playing video games for extended amounts of time can cause
                children to experience many of the same symptoms seen in
                computer vision syndrome in adults. Extensive viewing of the

                Researchers at Oxford University have taken this notion a step
                farther. After studying the issue of limiting video game time

                correlation, positive or negative, between digital or online
                activity and wellbeing. Limiting time spent playing games,
                therefore, might not be all that beneficial.
